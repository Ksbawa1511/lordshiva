                <p>
                    Shiva (/ˈʃɪvə/; Sanskrit: शिव, romanized: Śiva, lit. 'The Auspicious
                    One' [ɕɪʋɐ]), also known as Mahadeva (/məˈhɑː ˈdeɪvə/; Sanskrit:
                    महादेव:, romanized: Mahādevaḥ, lit. 'The Great God' [mɐɦaːd̪eːʋɐ]),or
                    Hara, is one of the principal deities of Hinduism. He is the Supreme
                    Being in Shaivism, one of the major traditions within Hinduism.

                <h2>The Destroyer</h2>
                <p>
                    Shiva is known as "The Destroyer" within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity
                    which also includes Brahma and Vishnu. In the Shaivite tradition, Shiva
                    is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe.
                    In the goddess-oriented Shakta tradition, the Supreme Goddess (Devi) is
                    regarded as the energy and creative power (Shakti) and the equal
                    complementary partner of Shiva.Shiva is one of the five equivalent
                    deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.

                <h2>Divine Aspects</h2>
                <p>
                    Shiva has many aspects, benevolent as well as fearsome. In benevolent
                    aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient Yogi who lives an ascetic life
                    on Mount Kailash as well as a householder with his wife Parvati and his
                    three children, Ganesha, Kartikeya and Ashokasundari. In his fierce
                    aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. Shiva is also known as
                    Adiyogi (the first Yogi), regarded as the patron god of yoga, meditation
                    and the arts.

                <h2>Sacred Attributes</h2>
                <p>
                    The iconographical attributes of Shiva are the serpent Vasuki around his
                    neck, the adorning crescent moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his
                    matted hair, the third eye on his forehead (the eye that turns
                    everything in front of it into ashes when opened), the trishula or
                    trident as his weapon, and the damaru drum. He is usually worshipped in
                    the aniconic form of lingam

                <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
                <p>
                    Shiva has pre-Vedic roots, and the figure of Shiva evolved as an
                    amalgamation of various older non-Vedic and Vedic deities, including the
                    Rigvedic storm god Rudra who may also have non-Vedic origins, into a
                    single major deity. Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely by Hindus
                    in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Indonesia (especially in Java and Bali).
