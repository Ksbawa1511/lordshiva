        Amarnath Temple is a Hindu shrine located in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir, India. A cave situated at an altitude of 
        3,888 m (12,756 ft),about 168 km from Anantnag city, the district headquarters, 141 km (88 mi) from Srinagar, the summer 
        capital of Jammu and Kashmir, reached through Pahalgam town. The shrine represents an important part of Hinduism.The cave, 
        located in Lidder Valley, is surrounded by glaciers, snowy mountains and is covered with snow most of the year, except for a short 
        period in the summer, when it is open to pilgrims. In 1989, pilgrims numbered between 12,000 and 30,000. In 2011, the numbers 
        reached a peak, crossing 6.3 lakh (630,000) pilgrims. In 2018 pilgrims numbered 2.85 lakh (285,000). The annual pilgrimage has 
        varied between 20 and 60 days.
        The Amarnath cave, abode of the Mahamaya Shakti Peetha, is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, temples on the Indian Subcontinent that 
        commemorate the location of fallen body parts of the Hindu deity Sati.

    <h1>Shiva Linga</h1>
       <p>
        The Shiva Lingam at the shrine is a Swayambhu lingam. The lingam is a natural stalagmite formation inside a 40 m (130 ft) tall cave at
         an elevation of 3,888 m (12,756 ft) on the Amarnath Mountain, which has a peak of 5,186 metres (17,014 ft). The stalagmite is formed 
         due to the freezing of water drops that fall from the roof of the cave onto the floor, resulting in an upward growth of an ice formation. 
         Here, the stalagmites considered as the lingam, a physical manifestation of Shiva, form a solid-dome-shape. Two smaller stalagmites are 
         thought to represent Parvati and Ganesha.

       <p>
        According to the ancient Hindu texts of the Mahabharata and Puranas a lingam represents Shiva. 
        The lingam waxes during May to August, as snow melts in the Himalayas above the cave, and water seeps into the rocks of the cave; 
        thereafter, the lingam gradually wanes.[unreliable source?] Religious beliefs hold that the lingam grows and shrinks with the phases of 
        the moon, reaching its height during the summer festival.[unreliable source?] Hindus believe this is the place where Shiva explained the 
        secret of life and eternity to his divine consort, Parvati.

       <p>
        Lidder Valley, where the cave is located, has a number of glaciers. In 2009, glaciologist M. N. Koul, the former head of the geography 
        department at the University of Jammu, has said that while more scientific studies are needed, contributors to change in lingam size could 
        include changes in the water's pathways to the lingum. The cave is made of limestone and gypsum. Heat generated by tourists affects
        the size of the stalagmite. Outside temperate changes also affect their size. To minimize artificially induced temperature changes,
        helicopter trips and helipad sites are regulated. There has been talk of artificially extending the life of the stalagmites, this has met 
        with objections

        Ancient history
    </h2>
    <p>
        The book Rajatarangini (Book VII v. 183) refers to Krishaanth or Amarnath. It is believed that in the 11th century CE, Queen Suryamati gifted 
        trishulas, banalingas and other sacred emblems to this temple.Rajavalipataka, begun by Prajna Bhatta, contains detailed references to the 
        pilgrimage to Amarnath Cave Temple. In addition, there are further references to this pilgrimage in many other ancient texts.

    </p>

<h2>
    
    Medieval history
</h2>
<p>
    The cave and the Shivling finds mention in Abu'l Fazl's 16th century work Ain-i-Akbari. According to him, the site attracted many pilgrims.
     He describes the waxing and waning of the lingam according to the seasons and the moon. François Bernier, a French physician, accompanied 
     Emperor Aurangzeb during his visit to Kashmir in 1663. In his book Travels in Mughal Empire, he provides an account of the places he visited, 
     noting that he was "pursuing journey to a grotto full of wonderful congelations, two days journey from Sangsafed" when he "received intelligence
      that my Nawab felt very impatient and uneasy on account of my long absence." The "grotto" referenced in this passage is obviously the Amarnath
       cave — as the editor of the second edition of the English translation of the book, Vincent A. Smith, makes clear in his introduction. 
       He writes: "The grotto full of wonderful congelations is the Amarnath cave, where blocks of ice, stalagmites formed by dripping water from the
        roof are worshipped by many Hindus who resort here as images of Shiva...."

<h2>
    Modern history

</h2>
<p>
    
    In 1895, pilgrims would first travel to Kheer Bhawani for a brief stop.Sustained by free rations from the state, the pilgrims would 
    then travel to Srinagar.From Srinagar, in batches, the pilgrims would then head up Lidder Valley, stopping at locations for holy dips.
    At Mach Bawan, local Hindus would join them. Maliks of Batok were responsible for the route during these years.Sister Nivedita, 
    in Notes of Some Wanderings with the Swami Vivekananda, writes of Swami Vivekananda's visit to the cave in 1898.

    Yatra suspensions and causes

</h2>

    <h3>

        2016: Kashmir unrest
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Amarnath pilgrimage was suspended in July 2016 due to the Kashmir unrest. Some Sufis and Shias later demanded resumption of the Yatra. 
        Kalbe Jawad, a Shia cleric and general secretary of Majlis-e-Ulama-e-Hind and Sufi cleric Hasnain Baqai expressed concern that the tradition had
        been suspended because of upheaval in Kashmir.

    </p>
    <h3>

        2019: Threat of terrorist attack
    </h3>
    <p>

        The pilgrimage was suspended in August 2019 after the state government stated there was a threat of possible terrorist attacks. Similarly, 
        the pilgrimage to Machail Mata was suspended as well. However, it was also speculated that the Yatra suspension might have been linked 
        to the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.
    </p>


<h3>2020 and 2021: COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
<p>

    The annual pilgrimage was cancelled in the year 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic. On 22 April 2020, the Shri Amarnath Ji Shrine 
    Board announced the suspension of the Yatra because of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Later however it withdrew the press circular and 
    announced cancellation of the suspension. Lieutenant Governor G. C. Murmu said that a final decision would depend on future developments
     related to the pandemic. In light of the pandemic, the union territory government on 4 July announced that only 500 people would be 
     permitted road travel to the shrine and everyone entering Jammu and Kashmir would be tested for COVID-19, and quarantined until their reports 
     came back negative. The pilgrimage was later cancelled on 21 July due to the pandemic, with cases of coronavirus in the union territory 
     increasing greatly since 1 July. Facilities for viewing the prayer ceremony online were made available.
</p>
<p>

    The shrine board on 27 March 2022 decided to resume the pilgrimage after a gap of two years, starting from 30 June and lasting for 43 days, 
    while following protocols to prevent the spread of COVID.

<h3>

    2022: temporary suspension due to flash flood
</h3>
<p>
    
    On 8 July 2022, at least 16 people were killed, over 40 missing, and dozens were injured while around 15000 pilgrims were stranded near 
    the Amarnath Holy cave due to a flash flood triggered by a cloudburst near the Lidder Valley en route to the venerated cave. The Amarnath
     Yatra was halted due to the flash flood on 8 July for 3 days.
