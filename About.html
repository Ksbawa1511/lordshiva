        <h1>Third Eye:</h1>
        
        <p>

            Shiva is often depicted with a third eye, with which he burned Desire (Kāma) to ashes, called "Tryambakam"
            (Sanskrit: त्र्यम्बकम् ),
            which occurs in many scriptural sources. In classical Sanskrit, the word ambaka denotes "an eye", and in the
            Mahabharata, Shiva
            is depicted as three-eyed, so this name is sometimes translated as "having three eyes". However, in Vedic
            Sanskrit, the word ambā
            or ambikā means "mother", and this early meaning of the word is the basis for the translation "three
            mothers". These three mother-
            goddesses who are collectively called the Ambikās.Other related translations have been based on the idea
            that the name actually
            refers to the oblations given to Rudra, which according to some traditions were shared with the goddess
            Ambikā.

        <h1>Crescent moon:</h1>
     
        <p>
            Shiva bears on his head the crescent moon.The epithet Candraśekhara (Sanskrit: चन्द्रशेखर "Having the moon
            as his crest" – candra
            = "moon"; śekhara = "crest, crown")refers to this feature. The placement of the moon on his head as a
            standard iconographic
            feature dates to the period when Rudra rose to prominence and became the major deity Rudra-Shiva.The origin
            of this linkage may
            be due to the identification of the moon with Soma, and there is a hymn in the Rig Veda where Soma and Rudra
            are jointly implored,
            and in later literature, Soma and Rudra came to be identified with one another, as were Soma and the moon.
        </p>

        <h1> Ashes: </h1>
        <p>
            Shiva iconography shows his body covered with ashes (bhasma, vibhuti).The ashes represent a reminder that
            all of material existence
            is impermanent, comes to an end becoming ash, and the pursuit of eternal Self and spiritual liberation is
            important.
        </p>

        <h1> Hair:</h1>
        <p>
            Shiva's distinctive hair style is noted in the epithets Jaṭin, "the one with matted hair",and Kapardin,
            "endowed with matted hair"
            or "wearing his hair wound in a braid in a shell-like (kaparda) fashion".A kaparda is a cowrie shell, or a
            braid of hair in the
            form of a shell, or, more generally, hair that is shaggy or curly.
        </p>

        <h1>Blue throat:</h1>
        <p>
            The epithet Nīlakaṇtha (Sanskrit नीलकण्ठ; nīla = "blue", kaṇtha = "throat").Since Shiva drank the Halahala
            poison churned up from the
            Samudra Manthana to eliminate its destructive capacity. Shocked by his act, Parvati squeezed his neck and
            stopped it in his neck to
            prevent it from spreading all over the universe, supposed to be in Shiva's stomach. However the poison was
            so potent that it changed
            the color of his neck to blue. This attribute indicates that one can become Shiva by swallowing the worldly
            poisons in terms of abuses
            and insults with equanimity while blessing those who give them.
        </p>

        <h1>Meditating yogi:</h1>
        <p>
            His iconography often shows him in a Yoga pose, meditating, sometimes on a symbolic Himalayan Mount Kailasha
            as the Lord of Yoga.
        </p>

        <h1>Sacred Ganga: </h1>
        <p>
            The epithet Gangadhara, "Bearer of the river Ganga" (Ganges). The Ganga flows from the matted hair of Shiva.
            The Gaṅgā (Ganga), one of
            the major rivers of the country, is said to have made her abode in Shiva's hair.
        </p>

        <h1>Tiger skin:</h1>
        <p>
            Shiva is often shown seated upon a tiger skin.
        </p>

        <h1>Serpents:</h1>
        <p>
            Shiva is often shown garlanded with a snake.
        </p>

        <h1>Trident:</h1>
        <p>
            Shiva typically carries a trident called Trishula. The trident is a weapon or a symbol in different Hindu
            texts. As a symbol, the
            Trishul represents Shiva's three aspects of "creator, preserver and destroyer", or alternatively it
            represents the equilibrium of
            three Gunas of "sattva, rajas and tamas"
        </p>

        <h1>Drum:</h1>
        <p>
            A small drum shaped like an hourglass is known as a damaru.This is one of the attributes of Shiva in his
            famous dancing representation
            known as Nataraja. A specific hand gesture (mudra) called ḍamaru-hasta (Sanskrit for "ḍamaru-hand") is used
            to hold the drum.This drum
            is particularly used as an emblem by members of the Kāpālika sect.
        </p>

        <h1>Axe:</h1>
        <p>
            (Parashu) and Deer are held in Shiva's hands in Odisha & south Indian icons.
        </p>

        <h1>Rosary beads:</h1>
        <p> is garlanded with or carries a string of rosary beads in his right hand, typically made of Rudraksha. This
            symbolises grace,
            mendicant life and meditation.
        </p>
        <h1>Nandī:</h1>
        <p>
            (Sanskrit: नन्दिन् (nandin)), is the name of the bull that serves as Shiva's mount. Shiva's association with
            cattle is reflected
            in his name Paśupati, or Pashupati (Sanskrit: पशुपति), translated by Sharma as "lord of cattle" and by
            Kramrisch as "lord of animals",
            who notes that it is particularly used as an epithet of Rudra.
        </p>

        <h1>Mount Kailāsa:</h1>
       
        <p>
            Mount Kailash in the Himalayas is his traditional abode. In Hindu mythology, Mount Kailāsa is conceived as
            resembling a Linga,
            representing the center of the universe.
        </p>

        <h1>Gaṇas:</h1>
        <p>
            The Gaṇas are attendants of Shiva and live in Kailash. They are often referred to as the bhutaganas, or
            ghostly hosts, on account of
            their nature. Generally benign, except when their lord is transgressed against, they are often invoked to
            intercede with the lord on
            behalf of the devotee. His son Ganesha was chosen as their leader by Shiva, hence Ganesha's title gaṇa-īśa
            or gaṇa-pati, "lord of the
            gaṇas".
        </p>

        <h1>Varanasi:</h1>
        <p>
            Varanasi (Benares) is considered to be the city specially loved by Shiva, and is one of the holiest places
            of pilgrimage in India.
            It is referred to, in religious contexts, as Kashi.
