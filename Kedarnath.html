        Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the God of the field') is
        a Hindu temple roughly
        1200 years old dedicated to Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range[citation needed] near
        the Mandakini river,
        in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public
        only between the months
        of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha
        (deity) of the temple is
        carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of
        Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand',
        the historical name of the region.
    </p>
    <p>

        The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek from
        Gaurikund. Pony, mule and
        manchan service is available to reach the temple. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by
        the Pandavas, and is one
        of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva. The Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva
        by doing penance in
        Kedarnath. The temple is one of the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas
        and is the first
        of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas. It is one of the 275
        paadal petra sthalams
        expounded in the Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th centuries by 63 saints
        called Nayanars. This temple
        is sung of by Thirugnanasambandar, Appar, Sundarar and Sekkizhar in their Tevaram texts.

        Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex,
        surrounding areas, and Kedarnath
        town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any major damage, apart from a few
        cracks on one side of the four
        walls which was caused by the flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a
        barrier, protecting the
        temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in the market area were heavily damaged.

        The temple, at a height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), 223 km (139 mi) from Rishikesh, on the shores of Mandakini
        river, a tributary of Ganga, is a
        stone edifice of unknown date.[8] It is not certain who built the original Kedarnath temple and when. The name
        "Kedarnath" means "the lord of
        the field": it derives from the Sanskrit words kedara ("field") and natha ("lord"). The text Kashi Kedara
        Mahatmya states that it is so called
        because "the crop of liberation" grows here.

        Many folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are
        narrated.
    </p>
    <p>

        A folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas
        defeated and slew their
        cousins — the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide
        (gotra hatya) and Brāhmanahatya
        (killing of Brahmins — the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to
        their kin and left in search of
        lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be
        Shiva's favourite city and known
        for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and
        dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war
        and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid
        in the Garhwal region.
    </p>

    <p>

        Not finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava
        brothers, then standing astride
        two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi ("hidden Kashi" — the name
        derived from the hiding act of Shiva).
        Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But
        the bull-formed Shiva
        disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing
        in Tungnath, the face showing
        up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in
        Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with
        this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping
        Shiva.
    </p>
    <p>

        A variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing.
        Consequently, the bull was torn
        asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the
        Himalayas.[10] After building the Panch
        Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then
        through the heavenly path called
        the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation.[citation needed].The Panch Kedar Temples
        are constructed in the
        North-Indian Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking
        similar.
    </p>
    <p>

        After completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious
        rite to visit Lord Vishnu
        at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.

        The Mahabharata, which gives the account of the Pandavas and the Kurukshetra War, does not mention any place
        called Kedarnath. One of the
        earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the Skanda Purana (c. 7th-8th century), which contains a story
        describing the origin of the Ganges
        river. The text names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where Shiva released the holy water from his matted hair.
    </p>
    <p>

        According to the hagiographies based on Madhava's Sankshepa-shankara-vijaya, the 8th century philosopher Adi
        Shankara died at the mountains
        near Kedarnath; although other hagiographies, based on Anandagiri's Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya, state that he died
        at Kanchipuram. The ruins of
        a monument marking the purported death place of Shankara are located at Kedarnath.[15] Kedarnath was definitely
        a prominent pilgrimage centre
        by the 12th century, when it is mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru written by the Gahadavala minister Bhatta
        Lakshmidhara.

        Kedarnath Teerth Purohits are the ancient Brahmins of this region, their ancestors (Rishi-Muni) have been
        worshiping the lingam since the
        time of Nara-Narayana and Daksh Prajapati. King Janmejay, grandson of the Pandavas, gave them the right of
        worshiping this temple and donate
        the whole Kedar region, and they have been worshiping pilgrims ever since.

    </p>
    <p>

        According to a tradition recorded by the English mountaineer Eric Shipton (1926), "many hundreds of years ago"
        one priest used to hold
        services at both the Kedarnath and Badrinath temples, travelling between the two places daily.

        The temple

        The presiding image of Kedarnath in the form of lingam is of irregular shape with a pedestal 3.6 m (12 ft) in
        circumference and 3.6 m (12 ft)
        in height. There is a small pillared hall in front of the temple, that has images of Parvati and of the five
        Pandava princes. There are four
        temples around Kedarnath itself, namely- Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar and Kalpeshwar which form the
        Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites.
        The first hall inside Kedarnath Temple contains statues of the five Pandava brothers, Krishna, Nandi, the
        vehicle of Shiva and Virabhadra,
        one of the guards of Shiva. Statues of Draupadi and other deities are also installed in the main hall. An
        unusual feature of the temple
        is the head of a man carved in the triangular stone lingam. Such a head is seen carved in another temple nearby
        constructed on the site where
        the marriage of Shiva and Parvati was held. Adi Shankara was believed to have revived this temple, along with
        Badrinath and other temples of
        Uttarakhand; he is believed to have attained Mahasamadhi at Kedarnath. Behind the temple is the samādhi mandir
        of Adi Sankara.

        The head priest (Raval) of the Kedarnath temple belongs to the Veerashaiva community from Karnataka. However,
        unlike in Badrinath
        temple, the Raval of Kedarnath temple does not perform the pujas. The pujas are carried out by Raval's
        assistants on his instructions. The
        Raval moves with the deity to Ukhimath during the winter season. There are five main priests for the temple, and
        they become head priests for
        one year by rotation. The present (2013) Raval of Kedarnath temple is Shri Vageesha Lingacharya from Davanagere
        district, Karnataka.
        Surrounding Kedarnath, there are many symbols of the Pandavas. Raja Pandu died at Pandukeshwar. The tribals here
        perform a dance called
        "Pandav Lila". The mountain top where the Pandavas went to Swarga, is known as "Swargarohini", which is located
        off Badrinath. When
        Yudhishtira, the eldest of the Pandavas, was leaving for the heaven, one of his fingers fell on the earth. At
        that place, Yudhishtira installed
        a Shiva Linga, which is the size of the thumb. To gain Mashisharupa, Lord Shiva and Bheema fought with maces.
        Bheema was struck with remorse.
        He started to massage Shiva's body with ghee. In memory of this event, even today, this triangular Shiva lingam
        is massaged with ghee. Water
        and bilva-patra leaves are used for worship.
