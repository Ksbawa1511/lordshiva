                <h2>About Kedarnath Temple</h2>
                <p>
                    Kedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. 'temple of the God of the field') is
                    a Hindu temple roughly 1200 years old dedicated to Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near
                    the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public
                    only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha
                    (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogenous form of
                    Shiva, the 'Lord of Kedarkhand', the historical name of the region.

                <h2>Access and Pilgrimage</h2>
                <p>
                    The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek from
                    Gaurikund. Pony, mule and manchan service is available to reach the temple. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by
                    the Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva. The Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva
                    by doing penance in Kedarnath. The temple is one of the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas
                    and is the first of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.

                <h2>2013 Flash Floods</h2>
                <p>
                    Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex,
                    surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any major damage, apart from a few
                    cracks on one side of the four walls which was caused by the flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a
                    barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in the market area were heavily damaged.

                <h2>History and Legends of Origin</h2>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Kedarnath_Temple_at_Dawn_-_OCT_2014.jpg/542px-Kedarnath_Temple_at_Dawn_-_OCT_2014.jpg" alt="Kedarnath Temple at Dawn">
                <p>
                    The temple, at a height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), 223 km (139 mi) from Rishikesh, on the shores of Mandakini
                    river, a tributary of Ganga, is a stone edifice of unknown date. It is not certain who built the original Kedarnath temple and when. The name
                    "Kedarnath" means "the lord of the field": it derives from the Sanskrit words kedara ("field") and natha ("lord"). The text Kashi Kedara
                    Mahatmya states that it is so called because "the crop of liberation" grows here.

                <h2>The Pandavas Legend</h2>
                <p>
                    A folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas
                    defeated and slew their cousins — the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide
                    (gotra hatya) and Brāhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins — the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to
                    their kin and left in search of lord Shiva and to seek his blessings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava
                    brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi ("hidden Kashi" — the name
                    derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But
                    the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing
                    in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in
                    Kalpeshwar.

                <p>
                    The presiding image of Kedarnath in the form of lingam is of irregular shape with a pedestal 3.6 m (12 ft) in
                    circumference and 3.6 m (12 ft) in height. There is a small pillared hall in front of the temple, that has images of Parvati and of the five
                    Pandava princes. There are four temples around Kedarnath itself, namely- Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar and Kalpeshwar which form the
                    Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites.

                <p>
                    The head priest (Raval) of the Kedarnath temple belongs to the Veerashaiva community from Karnataka. However,
                    unlike in Badrinath temple, the Raval of Kedarnath temple does not perform the pujas. The pujas are carried out by Raval's
                    assistants on his instructions. The Raval moves with the deity to Ukhimath during the winter season.
