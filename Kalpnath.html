                <h2>About Kalpnath Temple</h2>
                <p>
                    Kalpnath Temple is one of the five sacred temples of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage circuit, located at an altitude of 2,200 meters 
                    (7,217 feet) above sea level in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand, India. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is believed 
                    to be over 1000 years old. According to legend, this is where the hair of Lord Shiva appeared when the divine bull split into five parts.

                <h2>Access and Pilgrimage</h2>
                <p>
                    Kalpnath is accessible via a 10-kilometer trek from Urgam village, which is well-connected by road. The trek passes through beautiful 
                    forests and offers stunning views of the surrounding peaks. The temple remains open from April to November, closing during the harsh 
                    winter months when the deity is moved to Urgam. The temple is part of the sacred Panch Kedar pilgrimage that includes Kedarnath, 
                    Tungnath, Rudranath, and Madhyamaheshwar.

                <h2>Legend of Panch Kedar</h2>
                <p>
                    According to the Panch Kedar legend, after the Kurukshetra war, the Pandavas sought Lord Shiva's blessings to atone for their sins. 
                    Shiva, unwilling to meet them, took the form of a bull and disappeared into the ground. When Bhima caught the bull, it split into five parts. 
                    The hair of the bull appeared at Kalpnath, making it the fifth and final temple in the Panch Kedar circuit. The temple represents 
                    the hair of Lord Shiva and completes the sacred pilgrimage.
