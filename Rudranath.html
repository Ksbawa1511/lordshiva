                <h2>About Rudranath Temple</h2>
                <p>
                    Rudranath Temple is one of the five sacred temples of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage circuit, located at an altitude of 2,286 meters 
                    (7,500 feet) above sea level in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand, India. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is believed 
                    to be over 1000 years old. According to legend, this is where the face of Lord Shiva appeared when the divine bull split into five parts.

                <h2>Access and Pilgrimage</h2>
                <p>
                    Rudranath is accessible via a 20-kilometer trek from Gopeshwar, which is well-connected by road. The trek passes through beautiful 
                    forests and meadows, offering stunning views of the surrounding peaks. The temple remains open from April to November, closing during 
                    the harsh winter months when the deity is moved to Gopeshwar. The temple is part of the sacred Panch Kedar pilgrimage that includes 
                    Kedarnath, Tungnath, Madhyamaheshwar, and Kalpeshwar.

                <h2>Legend of Panch Kedar</h2>
                <p>
                    According to the Panch Kedar legend, after the Kurukshetra war, the Pandavas sought Lord Shiva's blessings to atone for their sins. 
                    Shiva, unwilling to meet them, took the form of a bull and disappeared into the ground. When Bhima caught the bull, it split into five parts. 
                    The face of the bull appeared at Rudranath, making it the third most important temple in the Panch Kedar circuit. The temple represents 
                    the face of Lord Shiva and is considered extremely sacred by devotees.

                    that resembles a human face, which is considered the primary deity. The temple complex includes smaller shrines dedicated to other deities 
                    and a sacred water spring known as Surya Kund.
