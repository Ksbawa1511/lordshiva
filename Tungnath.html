        Tungnath (IAST:tuņgnāth) is one of the highest Shiva temples in the world and is the highest of the five Panch
        Kedar temples
        located in the Rudraprayag district, in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The Tungnath (literal meaning: Lord of
        the peaks) mountains
        form the Mandakini and Alaknanda river valleys. It is located at an altitude of 3,690 m (12,106 ft), and just
        below the peak of
        Chandrashila. It has a rich legend linked to the Pandavas, heroes of the Mahabharata epic.

        According to Hindu mythology, Shiva and his consort, Parvati both reside in the Himalayas: Shiva resides at
        Mount Kailash. Parvati is
        also called Shailaputri, which means 'Daughter of the Mountain'. Many folk legends related to the Garhwal
        region, Shiva and the creation
        of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated.

        A folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas
        defeated and slayed their
        cousins — the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide
        (gotra hatya) and Brāhmanahatya
        (killing of Brahmins — the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to
        their kin and left in search of
        Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva's
        favourite city and known for its
        Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty
        at the Kurukshetra war and was,
        therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the
        Garhwal region.
    </p>
    <p>

        Not finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava
        brothers, then standing astride
        two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (“hidden Kashi” — the name
        derived from the hiding act of Shiva).
        Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But
        the bull-formed Shiva
        disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing
        in Tungnath, the face showing
        up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in
        Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with
        this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping
        Shiva. The Pandavas were thus
        freed from their sins.
    </p>
    <p>

        A variant of the tale credits Bhima of not only catching the bull, but also stopping it from disappearing.
        Consequently, the bull was torn
        asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas.[6]
        After building the Panch
        Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then
        through the heavenly path called
        the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation.[citation needed]. The Panch Kedar
        Temples are constructed in the
        North-Indian Himalayan Temple "Katyuri" architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples
        looking similar.

        After completing the pilgrimage of Shiva's darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious rite
        to visit Vishnu at the
        Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Shiva.

        Legend also states that Rama, the central character of Ramayana, meditated at the Chandrashila peak which is
        close to Tungnath, in India.
        It is also said that Ravana performed penance to Shiva, the lord of the peaks, when he resided here.

        The priest at this temple is a local Brahmin from Makkumath village, unlike the other Kedar temples where the
        priests are from South
        India, a tradition set by the eighth century Hindu seer Sankaracharya. It is also said that the Maithani
        Brahmins of Makkumath Village
        officiate as priests at this temple. During the winter season, the temple is closed and the symbolic image of
        the deity and the temple
        priests are moved to Markandeshwar Temple in Makkumath village, which is 29km from here. It is near Duggalbitha
        10 km (6 mi) before Chopta
        towards Ukhimath.
