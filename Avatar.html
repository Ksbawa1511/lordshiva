    <h1>1. Piplaad Avatar</h1>
    <p>
        This avatar of Lord Shiva was born to Sage Dadhichi and his wife, Swarcha. However, he lost his parent's son
        after his birth.
        He was raised by his aunt Dadhimati. As he grew up and learnt about the cause of his father's death, Piplaad
        cursed Shani Dev
        (Saturn). He wanted to avenge Shani Dev for causing troubling his father during his lifetime. As a result, Shani
        Dev fell from the
        galaxy. However, after the Devas intervened, Piplaad agreed to forgive Shani by saying that none below sixteen
        would get affected
        by his adverse effects. Therefore, those who have Shani Dosha worship Lord Shiva.
