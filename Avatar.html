                <h2>1. Piplaad Avatar</h2>
                <p>
                    This avatar of Lord Shiva was born to Sage Dadhichi and his wife, Swarcha. However, he lost his parent's son
                    after his birth. He was raised by his aunt Dadhimati. As he grew up and learnt about the cause of his father's death, Piplaad cursed Shani Dev (Saturn). He wanted to avenge Shani Dev for causing troubling his father during his lifetime. As a result, Shani Dev fell from the galaxy. However, after the Devas intervened, Piplaad agreed to forgive Shani by saying that none below sixteen would get affected by his adverse effects. Therefore, those who have Shani Dosha worship Lord Shiva.

                <p>
                    This form of Lord Shiva was born to Sage Shilada. The sage performed intense penance to seek Lord Shiva's
                    blessings and asked for a child who would remain immortal. Therefore, pleased by Sage's devotion, Lord Shiva took birth as Nandi, who then became the gate-keeper of Kailasha (Lord Shiva's heavenly abode) and the mount of the Lord.

                <p>
                    The Veerabhadra avatar of Lord Shiva is one of his fiercest forms. Lord Shiva incarnated as Veerabhadra after
                    his wife Sati's death. The Veerabhadra form of Lord Shiva destroyed King Daksha's Yagya and beheaded him for being responsible for Sati's death.

                <p>
                    The Bhairava Avatar also is one of the fiercest avatars of Lord Shiva. Referred to as Dandapani, the Bhairava
                    Avatar punishes those who are greedy, lustful and arrogant. These negative traits often lead to one's downfall, and hence the purpose of the Bhairava avatar.

                    Guru Dronacharya had performed intense penance to please Lord Shiva. He wanted the Lord to be born as his son.

                    tribal man named Aahuk lost his life while safeguarding his guest, Yatinath. Instead of mourning, his wife took pride in him for giving away his life for the sake of a guest. Pleased by the couple's devotion, Lord Shiva blessed them by saying that they would be born as Nala and Damayanti in their next birth.
                </p>
